## Project

**Important things to remember:**
- You need to have the backend in JavaScript (as we learn in the course). The Frontend is in HTML and JavaScript. Use MySQL for the database. You need to do at least one external API call.
- The Backend should be available as an API.
- Do not use the HSBC name or Logo anywhere in the project.
- Each table is working together as a team.
- Presentation day will be at the end of the course, exact date and time still needs to be defined.
- Your manager will check your GitHub and your Jira. They expect participation of everybody of the team.
- Make the frontend look beautiful!
- Add a README file to your git project.

**Frequently asked questions (FAQ):**
- Backend language: Javascript
- Minimum requirement is to do a CRUD for the stocks inside the portfolio (**c**reate new entries, **r**ead entries, **u**pdate entries, **d**elete entries)
- Frontend: at least Javascript, you can do anything, you feel comfortable with. But don't try out something new, you will loose time, which you will not have.
- Database: MySQL (is already installed, if you are good in PostgreSQL you can use PostgreSQL as well)
- Project start: now.
- A protfolio is for managing your stocks.
- Everything is good, as long as you can explain, why you did it.

**Additional tipps**
- If you want to make use of exchange rates, you can use the API at https://openexchangerates.org/ . You need to registerto get a personal API key. Use the **free plan**. It provides hourly updates (with base currency USD) and up to 1,000 requests/month, which should be fine for what you want to do.
